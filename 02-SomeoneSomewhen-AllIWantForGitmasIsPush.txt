# Someone somewhen - All I want for Gitmas is Push
* Straight ahead just ripped the lyrics of All I Want For Christmas Is You and replaced some words

*Verse 1*
I don't want a lot for Gitmas
There is just one thing I need
Don't care about the presents
Underneath the Gitmas tree
I don't need to hang my stocking

*Verse 2*
There upon the fireplace
Linus Torvalds won't make me happy
With a toy on Gitmas Day
I just want Push for my own
